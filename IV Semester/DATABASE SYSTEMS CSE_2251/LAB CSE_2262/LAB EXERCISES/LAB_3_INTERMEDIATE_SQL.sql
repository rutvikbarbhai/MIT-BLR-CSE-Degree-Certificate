Set Operations
UNION (Use union all to retain duplicates):
1. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 or in Spring 2010
INTERSECT (Use intersect all to retain duplicates):
2. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 and in spring 2010
MINUS:
3. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 but not in Spring 2010
Null values
4. Find the name of the course for which none of the students registered.
